This was my first independent project in Python. I accessed an open access dataset from GCP. After connecting to the client, I explored a few different areas within the dataset. In addition to normal challenges with a first project, this dataset has nested code, which adds an extra layer of complexity with how the SQL queries interacted with Python. I ultimately decided to move to querying the revenue overtime by country over the dataset's time frame and creating a visualization from that in matplotlib. 

Next, I wanted to calculate main financial metrics, such as profit margin, but there was no data available for COGS. I settled for just revenue. Then I realized that there were 2 different places in the data that had revenue, in the items columns and ecommerce columns. They didn't match each other. I wanted to compare how far off they were from one another and show this in a graph. Ultimately, the nested data made this difficult. I figured out that I needed to calculate each with separate SQL queries. If they were in the same, groupby wouldn't add them up correctly. 

Also, the nested data affected the way the index in the dataframes interacted with matplotlib. I realized at this point that the Python/SQL problems I was working through mainly involved working around nested data, which I wasn't as likely to face in the 'real world' so I started working on other things.
