This was my first independent project in Python. I accessed an open access dataset from GCP. After connecting to the client, I explored a few different areas within the dataset. In addition to normal challenges with a first project, this dataset has nested code, which adds an extra layer of complexity with how the SQL queries interacted with Python. I ultimately decided to move to querying the revenue overtime by country over the dataset's time frame and creating a visualization from that in matplotlib.
